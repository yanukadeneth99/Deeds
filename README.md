# 👋 Introduction

A contract that users can use to list their house information onchain. The deeds can then be listed for sale for people to buy onchain without any intermediery. With that, plus having this in a contract on the blockchain, this enables people to sell their house in a secure platform.

Anyone can view who the house belongs to, and depending on whether the house is listed for sale or not, the amount of details presented to public is limited.

## ✍️ Project Description

### 🤔 Why Blockchain

By running on this on a contract on a blockchain, this gives people few advantages listed below.

1. Immutability - Data on the blockchain cannot be changed once it's written by default.
2. Transparency - Anyone can view the information without having to go through to any entitity freely.
3. Decentralised - Data is not hosted in a single place or in a single server/company. The data presented can be guaranteed not to be unavailable and not tampered with by some central entity for their benefit.

By default, this makes the blockchain the best place to keep deeds.

### 🤩 Features

- Create and Upate Deeds.
- List a created deed for sale.
- Specify House information (size, bedrooms, etc).
- Buy listed deed.
- View who owns a created deed.
